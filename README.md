## Assignments  

### **Assignment 1: Hodgkin-Huxley Model**  
- **Objective**:  
  Simulate the Hodgkin-Huxley model, a fundamental mathematical framework for describing the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons.  
- **Description**:  
  - The model uses a system of differential equations to represent the electrical characteristics of a neuron.  
  - It describes the ionic conductances and currents (sodium, potassium, and leak currents) responsible for generating action potentials.  
- **Tools Used**:  
  - Python with libraries such as **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** for solving and visualizing differential equations.

### **Assignment 2: FitzHugh-Nagumo Neuron Model**  
- **Objective**:  
  Implement the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, a simplified version of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, for studying excitable systems like neurons.  
- **Description**:  
  - This model reduces the complexity of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations while preserving the qualitative behavior of neuronal excitability.  
  - It consists of two equations representing the dynamics of the membrane potential and a recovery variable.  
- **Applications**:  
  - Ideal for understanding the basic dynamics of neuronal excitation and inhibition.  
- **Tools Used**:  
  - Python for numerical integration and visualization.

- **Applications**:  
  - Understanding synchronization phenomena in neural systems or other biological networks.  
- **Tools Used**:  
  - Python for solving coupled differential equations and plotting phase and amplitude dynamics.
